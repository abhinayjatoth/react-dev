Developement Notes
When you want to dynamically pass data to a component, you pass it as a prop

Config Friven UI?

Give key when loop over children
We do not use index as a key

- Not using keys(not acceptable <<<<<< Index as key(not recommended) <<<<<<< Unique Id(Recommended)
- Make seperate files for seperate components
- React doesnâ€™t have opinions on how you put files into folders. That said there are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem you may want to consider.

Two types of exports and imports

1. Default Export/Import
   export detault ComponentName;
   import ComponentName from "path";

2. Named Export/Import;
   export cont ComponentName;
   import ComponentName from "path";

Hooks:
Normal JS function given by react - comes with some superpowers

- ueState() - Component renderes whenere there is a change in varaible
- useEffect(() => {},[]//dependanyc aray) - with callback function with a dependancy array
  If no dependancy array, useEffect is called on every render
  If there is an empty dependancy array, useEffect is called on only once.
  If there is a variable declared, it is called everytime dependancy variable is updated
  Never use useEffect() in if else condition, loops and functions- in documentation. Its only done n componentsand on top

useEffect is called after the body component is rendered

Whenever a state variable is changed, react will re render the whole component

React Routing So

Routing:
createBrowserRouter(recommenderd router for react router)
RouterProvider- router configuration

Dontuse anchor tag when using React - navigate to new page without reloading new page
Use Link component
