Lot of packages makes our code fast, not just react
We need to get those packages into our app

Install node package manager
NPM - package manager where all packages are hosted
Takes care of all packages and its versions

Bundlers - bundles your app which will help in ship to production - Parcel, Webpack

// npm install -D Parcel (-D dev dependancy)
2 types of packages , dev dependancy and normal dependancy

"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.3" // ^ = caret -> parcel will update its version with this symbol 
  }

  package.json - keeps track of approx version
  and package-lock.json- keeps track of exact version

node-modules is not required in github

package.json and package-lock.json is requred in github


NPX - executing a package
npx parcel index.html

CDN is not a good way to add react into our project

No need of script tag to import react in index.html
after import add type module in html file

Parcel -
-Dev build
-Local Server
-HMR - Hot Module replacement(Automatically replaces our page)
-File Watching algorithm- written in C++ 
-Faster Builds - Caching
